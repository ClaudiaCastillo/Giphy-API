# Giphy-API
Giphy API Assignment.

Use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs. 
Call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

GIPHY requires developers to use a key to access their API data. For now, use their public API key.

The app should take the topics from an array and create buttons in the HTML for each string in the array.
When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page. 
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
For every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on) supplied by the GIPHY API. 
Add a form to the page that takes the value from a user input box and adds it into the topics array. T
